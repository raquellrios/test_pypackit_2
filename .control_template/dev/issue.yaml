            Before submitting a report, please make sure that you are following our
            <a href="${{url.website.contributing}}">Contributing Guidelines</a> to verify that:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Your request is in fact for a breaking change, and not a new feature or an enhancement.
              </li>
              <li>
                The request has not yet been filed by another person.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <blockquote>

                This verification process is non-trivial, and can be time-consuming.
                If you are not a collaborator and don't have the time to go through the process,
                you can always open a discussion instead; we will investigate the problem as soon as possible,
                and convert the discussion into an issue if the request is valid.
