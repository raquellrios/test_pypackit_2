      https://pypackit.repodynamics.com/contribute\">Contributing Guidelines</a> to
      verify that: <ol>\n  <li>\n    Your request is in fact for a breaking change,
      and not a new feature or an enhancement.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    The request has
      not yet been filed by another person.\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n    üí° <a

      is non-trivial, and can be time-consuming.\n    If you are not a collaborator
      and don't have the time to go through the process,\n    you can always open
      a discussion instead; we will investigate the problem as soon as possible,\n\
      \    and convert the discussion into an issue if the request is valid.\n</blockquote>\n
