## Maintenance





## General Repository Settings





### Start Year
The year in which the project was started. This is used to generate the copyright notice.

### GitHub
GitHub username and repository name of the project.

There seems to be no official GitHub documentation regarding repository naming rules.
[Experimentally determined rules](https://stackoverflow.com/a/59082561/14923024) are:
GitHub repository names can only contain alphanumeric characters,
plus hyphen (-), underscore (_), and dot (.), i.e. they must match the regex '^[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+$'.
All other characters are automatically replaced with hyphens, that is:
```python
repo_name = re.sub(r'[^A-Za-z0-9_.-]', '-', project_name),
```

Also, GitHub retains the capitalization only when displaying the repository name;
otherwise, names are not case-sensitive. That is, "PyPackIT" will be displayed as is,
but any other capitalization of the word in any URL or address will also point to the same repository.

### Authors
GitHub usernames of project's main authors.


## Package Data

### `package.development_status`
- integer

Development status of the package,

## Maintainers


### Issues
Maintainers that are automatically assigned to each opened issue.

Each key is the name of an issue template form (YAML file) under './github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/', with the leading
integer and underscore stripped; e.g. for '1_bug_api.yaml', the key is 'bug_api'.
The 'default' key is used for all other issue forms that are not explicitly named here.
The values are lists of GitHub usernames.

### Pull Requests
Code owners that will be automatically requested to review pull requests before merging.

Each key is a glob pattern (with slightly modified rules; see reference) to match files and directories that
a list of GitHub usernames (the value) own.

#### Notes
* Code owners must have write permissions for the repository.
* For code owners to be automatically requested for reviews, the option must be enabled:
https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches#require-pull-request-reviews-before-merging
* Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most precedence.
