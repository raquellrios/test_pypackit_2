## Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)

[Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)](https://peps.python.org/) are documents that describe and discuss
proposed improvements, new features, or significant changes to the Python programming language.
They are the primary mechanism for the Python community to propose and communicate ideas and design decisions
related to Python's development. Once a PEP is accepted,
it may result in changes being implemented in Python itself,
influencing the language's future versions and development direction.
PEPs also impose conditions and guidelines on many aspects of the language,
from coding style ([PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/))
to version number scheme ([PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/)).
