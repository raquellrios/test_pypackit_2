# Copyright
By default, PyPackIT uses the creation date of your repository,
and the name of the repository owner (set in their GitHub account),
to generate a copyright notice, which is used in README files and on your website.
The notice is of the form `{START-YEAR}â€“{CURRENT-YEAR} {OWNER-NAME}` (e.g. `2023â€“2024 John Doe`)
when the repository creation year is not the same as the current year,
and `{CURRENT-YEAR} {OWNER-NAME}` (e.g. `2024 John Doe`) otherwise.


## Setting
You can customize this notice by setting the following keys under the `copyright` key:

:year_start: ***integer***, ***optional***

    The start year of the project to use instead of the repository creation year.

:owner: ***string***, ***optional***

    The name of the project owner to use instead of the repository owner name.

## Usage

- On the footer of every page on your website.
- In the main README file of your repository.
- In the main docstring of your package.
