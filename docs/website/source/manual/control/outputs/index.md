The options available in your repository's control center can be divided into three categories:
- {{ pp_meta.name }}-specific configurations and data; these are directly read from your
  control center's contents whenever needed.
- GitHub-specific configurations and data that can be directly set using GitHub's UI, CLI, or API;
  these are directly applied to your repository by {{ pp_meta.name }}.
- Configurations and data for your GitHub/Git repository, package, test-suite, documentation website,
  and all external tools used in your project, which must be placed in specific files
  at specific locations in your repository, to be read and used by the corresponding
  platforms, tools, and services that require them.

This section covers the third category, providing a full reference of all such files
that are automatically generated in your repository by {{ pp_meta.name }}.


:::{admonition} Dynamic Files
:class: important

These are all dynamic files, meaning that {{ pp_meta.name }} will automatically
update them whenever you apply changes to the corresponding options in your control center.
Therefore, you should never manually edit these files, as your changes will be overwritten
by {{ pp_meta.name }} the next time they are updated. Instead, you should always
apply your changes to the corresponding options in the control center.
