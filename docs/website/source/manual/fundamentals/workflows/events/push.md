# Push

The [`push`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#push) event
is triggered when a commit or tag is pushed to a branch in the remote repository.
It is also triggered when branches are created or deleted,
or when the repository is created for the first time.
